# TenantPlus
##TenantPlus takes the hassle out of managing the applications for rental properties.

Instead of manually collecting application forms from each of the prospective tenants, the landlord can give each tenant a link to their private page where they can each enter their information in a cusomisable form. The landlord can then review each one and send to their lawyers etc for further review and filing.

This is written in an older version of Laravel and needs some substantial changes to be able to be used with the current release of Laravel. It works though.
